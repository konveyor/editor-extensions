The Konveyor extension comes packaged with default analyzer and Generative AI binaries. However, you may want to use a custom or updated version of these binaries.

To override the default analyzer, run the [Konveyor: Override Analyzer Binaries](command:konveyor.overrideAnalyzerBinaries) command, and to override the Generative AI binary, run the[Konveyor: Override Generative AI Binaries](command:konveyor.overriderpcServerBinaries) command.
