# Start Analyzer

Start using the rules-based analysis engine.

Remember to configure your analysis settings beforehand for the best results:

Set up custom rules if needed.
Configure label selector directly or through choosing sources and targets.
These settings can be modified in the Konveyor extension settings or through the walkthrough steps you've already completed.
