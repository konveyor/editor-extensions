Start Analyzer
==============

Start using the rules-based analysis engine.

Remember to configure your analysis settings beforehand for the best results:
- Set up [custom rules](command:konveyor.configureCustomRules) if needed.
- Configure [label selector](command:konveyor.configureLabelSelector) directly or through choosing [sources and targets](command:konveyor.configureSourcesTargets).

These settings can be modified in the Konveyor extension settings or through the walkthrough steps you've already completed.
