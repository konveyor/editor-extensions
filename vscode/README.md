## Excluding paths from analysis

The extension can be configured to ignore certain files and paths when performing analysis
and report issues.

Path exclusion configuration follow this priority ordering:

1. The extension will look for `.konveyorignore` files first. They are expected to follow the
   [standard `.gitignore` syntax](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore). If any `.konveyorignore`
   files are found in the workspace, they will be used.

2. If no `.konveyorignore` files are found, any found `.gitignore` files will be used.

3. If neither are found, a default set of ignores will be used. (`.vscode/`, `target/`, `.git/`,
   and `node_modules/`).

Due to some restrictions in underlying technology, exclusions apply to directories only. While
the [gitignore syntax](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) allows for individual file exclusions.
Only directory exclusion will be applied. This may cause some individual files to be included
if they're named directly.
